This is a simple test project, created for low and high pass data stream filtering.
In this project, filter is used to smooth mouse movements to decide if mouse vector changes on x axis.

Filter class can be accessed from blueprint. Low or high setting pass can be changed from blueprint also.
Change cut frequency and rate to your needs.
*Graph you see in this project is not part of the filter code.*
